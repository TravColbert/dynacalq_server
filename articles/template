    "One of the major goals of DynaCalq is to hide complex mathematical and analytical formulas behind an easy to use interface. On occasion there's a need for a more general calculation tool. It's for that reason that we've introduced our latest DynaCalq tool called the <b><i>Quick Calculator</i><b>.",
    "The Quick Calculator allows you to punch-in mathematical calculation in the more traditional manner: You enter the calculation in the upper field and out comes your results in the lower field. Simple!",
    "<b>Expressions in the Quick Calculator</b>",
    "The exciting thing about the Quick Calculator is just how many operations this little tool supports! It's jam-packed with useful mathematical expressions. Let's explain the Quick Calculator's many expressions.",
    "<b>The Rules</b>",
    "1. Like most calculators, you don't need to enter the '=' sign in your expressions. Just start typing the expression.",
    "2. You can use <i>operators</i> like:",
    "<b>()</b> - grouping operator",
    "<pre>(2+3)*2</pre>",
    "The above equals <b>10</b>, not <b><i>12</i></b>. This is because we've used the group operators to force addition to take precedence over the multiplication operation.",
    "<b>+ - * / %</b> - arithmetic operators: <i>addition, subtraction, multiply, divide, modulo (remainder)</i> operators",
    "<b>^</b> - power operator",
    "<b>!</b> - factorial operator",
    "Here are some examples:",
    "<pre></pre>",
    "<b>Field-Level Calculations</b>",
    "Our first incredible trick is actually a whole bunch of tricks all bundled into one. We call them <i>Field-Level Calculations</i>. Here's how they work:",
    "There are some formulas where it is helpful to <i>pre-calculate</i> a number before entering it into the formula's field. A good example is our <b>Interest</b> formula. We concede that it can be little unnerving trying to remember how many months compose a 30-year loan (it's <i>360</i>).",
    "So, wouldn't it be nice if, instead of entering this into the <b>Periods</b> field:",
    "<pre>360</pre>",
    "... you could enter this:",
    "<pre>3*12</pre>",
    "That is to say: <b><i>3 years times 12 months per year</i></b>? "
    "That's a fair question. After all... how many times in the last week, month, or even year have you actually calculated the area of <i>anything!</i> While it is true that we may not often come across reasons to calculate the area of a rectangle, you'd be surprised by how many circumstances we <i>could</i> or <i>should</i> use this basic calculation. We at DynaCalq tend to believe that most of us <i>avoid</i> using what we learned in grade school geometry class simply because we may not be as confident in our calculative abilities as we were in grade school.",
    "So, here are a few examples of why you'd want to calculate the area of a rectangular space:",
    "<b>Home Improvement Project: Calculating how much grass seed to purchase</b>:",
    "Want to reseed your lawn? Knowing the square-footage of your lawn is the only way to properly determine how many bags of grass seed to purchase.",
    "Somewhere on the packaging of your chosen grass seed are <i>two figures</i>. One is usually much larger than the other. On one popular grass seed package we found this:",
    "<b><i>3lb: up to 1,300 sq. ft. reseeding. 650 sq. ft. New Lawn.</i></b>",
    "These numbers say: \"This is a 3-pound bag of grass seed. If you are seeding a brand-<b>new lawn</b> from bare ground, this bag will cover <b>650 square feet</b>. If you are reseeding a lawn (for example, if you have thin or bare spots in your lawn), this bag will cover <b>1,300 square feet</b>.",
    "So, knowing the square footage of your lawn will help you determine how many bags of grass seed you should buy.",
    "<span class='note'><b>Note:</b> Each grass mix has it's own coverage recomendation. Try to find the coverage recommendation on your grass seed's packaging. However, a general rule of thumb is: 4-5 pounds of seed for 1,000 square feet of lawn."
